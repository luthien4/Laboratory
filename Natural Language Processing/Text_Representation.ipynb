    "- **Corpus**: is the entire collection of texts used for analysis or modeling (machine learning tasks, or to train NLP models)\n",
    "    - *Example*: The entire collection of Wikipedia articles in English, a collection of legal documents, or a set of medical research papers can all be considered corpora.\n",
    "- **Vocabulary** ($V$): is the set of unique words (or tokens) present in a corpus. It represents the entire lexical repertoire of a language or domain.\n",
    "    - *Example*: In a corpus of scientific articles, the vocabulary would include terms like \"hypothesis,\" \"experiment,\" \"data,\" etc.\n",
    "- **Document**: is a single unit of text within the corpus, often representing a separate entity. It can be a single article, a sentence, a paragraph, or any chunk of text that is considered as a separate entity for analysis.\n",
    "    - *Example*: In a corpus of news articles, each individual news article is considered a document.\n",
    "- **Word**: is the basic linguistic unit, which can be a single word or a tokenized element in a text. These tokens can be words, punctuation marks, or other meaningful units.\n",
    "    - *Example*: In the sentence \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,\" the words are \"The,\" \"quick,\" \"brown,\" \"fox,\" \"jumps,\" \"over,\" \"the,\" \"lazy,\" and \"dog.\"\n",

    "**Core Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP), \"core intuition\" refers to the fundamental understanding or insight that underlies the way humans process and understand language. It is the foundational principle that guides the development of NLP models and algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some core intuitions in NLP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Semantics and Syntax*:\n",
    "    - Understanding that language has both semantic (meaning) and syntactic (grammar and structure) components. This intuition guides the development of models that can grasp the meaning of sentences and understand their grammatical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Context Matters*:\n",
    "    - Recognizing that the meaning of a word or phrase can change based on the surrounding context. For example, the word \"bank\" has different meanings in \"river bank\" and \"financial bank.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Ambiguity*:\n",
    "    - Acknowledging that language can be ambiguous, with words or phrases having multiple possible interpretations. NLP models need to be able to handle this ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Sequential Information*:\n",
    "    - Appreciating that the order of words in a sentence carries important information. This is particularly crucial for tasks like machine translation or sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Domain Specificity*:\n",
    "    - Understanding that language can be highly specialized and context-dependent, especially in technical or domain-specific domains. NLP models may need to adapt to different domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Pragmatics and Contextual Inference*:\n",
    "    - Realizing that communication often relies on pragmatic aspects, such as implicatures, presuppositions, and conversational implicatures. NLP models may need to infer information beyond the explicit content of a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Linguistic Variation*:\n",
    "    - Recognizing that language use can vary widely based on factors like dialect, socio-cultural context, and individual idiosyncrasies. NLP models need to be robust to these variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Figurative Language*:\n",
    "    - Understanding that language can include metaphors, similes, and other figurative expressions. NLP models may need to recognize and interpret these non-literal uses of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "These core intuitions serve as the basis for developing NLP models that can perform tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, machine translation, question answering, and more. They guide researchers and practitioners in designing algorithms that can effectively process and understand human language."

    "**Feature Extraction from Text** involves **converting raw text data into a numerical format** that can be used as input for machine learning models. This is a crucial step in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, as most machine learning algorithms require numerical input. The extracted features are then used as input for machine learning models to perform tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and more. The choice of feature extraction technique depends on the specific NLP task, the nature of the data, and the characteristics of the text corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are **some common techniques** for feature extraction from text:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Bag of Words (BoW)*:\n",
    "    - BoW represents text data as a collection of words, disregarding grammar and word order. It creates a vocabulary of all unique words in a corpus and counts the frequency of each word in a document. Each document is then represented as a vector where each element corresponds to the frequency of a word in the vocabulary.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)*:\n",
    "    - TF-IDF is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). It takes into account both the frequency of a word in a document (Term Frequency) and the rarity of the word in the entire corpus (Inverse Document Frequency).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Word Embeddings*:\n",
    "    - Word embeddings are dense, low-dimensional vectors that represent words in a continuous vector space. Techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText learn these embeddings by considering the context in which words appear. They capture semantic relationships between words and are effective in capturing word similarity and analogy.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Word Counts and Character Counts*:\n",
    "    - Simple features like the total number of words in a document, average word length, or frequency of specific characters can also be used as features.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- *N-grams*:\n",
    "    - N-grams are sequences of $N$ consecutive words. For example, Bi-grams consist of pairs of adjacent words. By considering sequences of words, N-grams can capture more context compared to BoW.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging*:\n",
    "    - POS tagging assigns a grammatical label to each word in a sentence (e.g., noun, verb, adjective). These tags can be used as features to capture linguistic information.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Sentiment Scores*:\n",
    "    - Sentiment analysis tools can be used to assign sentiment scores to text, indicating the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in the text.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Topic Modeling*:\n",
    "    - Topic modeling techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) can be used to extract topics from a collection of documents. The distribution of topics in a document can be used as features.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Syntactic Features*:\n",
    "    - Features related to sentence structure, such as the presence of specific grammatical constructs (e.g., passive voice, conditional clauses), can be used.\n",

    "\n",
    "- *Dependency Parsing*:\n",
    "    - Features based on syntactic relationships between words in a sentence can be used to capture structural information.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Lexical Diversity Measures*:\n",

    "**One Hot Encoding** is a technique used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to **convert categorical data, such as words or labels, into a numerical format** that can be used as input for machine learning algorithms. It's particularly useful when dealing with categorical features in text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how One Hot Encoding works in the context of NLP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Word Tokenization*:\n",
    "    - The first step in NLP is to break down text data into individual words or tokens. Each unique word becomes a category that we want to represent numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Creating a <b>Vocabulary</b>*:\n",
    "    - Next, we create a vocabulary, which is a set of all unique words in the corpus. This vocabulary will serve as the basis for One Hot Encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Assigning Indices*:\n",
    "    - Each word in the vocabulary is assigned a unique index. For example, the first word might be assigned index 0, the second word index 1, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *One Hot Encoding*:\n",
    "    - For each word in a sentence or document, a vector of all zeros is created, with a length equal to the size of the vocabulary. The element at the index corresponding to the word's index in the vocabulary is set to 1, while all other elements remain 0. This way, each word is represented as a binary vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For example, if we have a vocabulary with 10 words, and the word \"apple\" has an index of 3, its One Hot Encoding vector will look like [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This encoding ensures that each word has a unique representation, and the vectors are orthogonal (meaning they are mutually independent).\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words*:\n",
    "    - If a word is encountered in the future that is not in the original vocabulary, it can be handled by assigning a special \"Out of Vocabulary\" (OOV) token or by extending the vocabulary and re-encoding the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Sparse Matrix Representation*:\n",
    "    - In practice, One Hot Encoding results in a sparse matrix where most of the values are zero. This is because most documents only contain a small subset of the entire vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Notes: </u>\n",
    "One Hot Encoding is a straightforward and widely used technique for representing categorical data in NLP tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and more.\n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "    - Intuitive, easy to implement\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "    - *Sparsity*, i.e. it can lead to high-dimensional feature spaces, which may not be efficient for very large vocabularies (overfitting) (In such cases, techniques like word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) are preferred, as they provide more compact and semantically meaningful representations of words.)\n",
    "    - *No fixed size*\n",
    "    - *Out Of Vocabulary problem (OOV)*: It refers to the issue that arises when encountering words in new, unseen data that were not present in the original vocabulary used for encoding. If, during testing or real-world use, the model encounters a word that was not present in the original training data's vocabulary, it faces a problem. Since the word is not in the vocabulary, it cannot be represented using the OHE method. For example, if the word \"neologism\" was not present in the original training data, and it is encountered during testing, the model would not know how to represent it. It's important to choose an appropriate strategy based on the specific NLP task and the nature of the OOV words.\n",
    "        - **Strategies for Handling OOV Words**:\n",
    "                - *Ignoring the Word*: One option is to simply ignore OOV words. This may work in some cases if the OOV words are not critical for the task.\n",
    "                - *Replacing with a Special Token*: Replace OOV words with a special token like <UNK> (unknown) to indicate that the word is not recognized.\n",
    "                - *Expanding the Vocabulary*: If OOV words are common or critical for the task, you might consider retraining the model with an expanded vocabulary that includes the OOV words.\n",
    "    - *No capturing of semantic*\n",

    "**The Bag of Words (BoW)** method is a fundamental technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) used for text processing and feature extraction. It's called \"bag\" because it **involves treating text data as an unordered collection or bag of words, disregarding grammar, word order, and context**. BoW is widely used in various NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, document classification, and information retrieval. The BoW model represents a document as a vector of word frequencies. where each dimension of the vector corresponds to a unique words in the Vocabulary. The value at each dimension is the count of how many times that word appears in the document (absolute frequency)\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to one-hot encoding, BoW maps words to unique integer IDs between 1 and |V|. Each document in the corpus is then converted into a vector of |V| dimensions were in the ith component of the vector, i = wid, is simply the number of times the word w occurs in the document, i.e., we simply score each word in V by their occurrence count in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the **key steps** and concepts in the Bag of Words method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Tokenization*:\n",
    "    - The first step is to break down a piece of text into individual words or tokens. This process may involve removing punctuation and handling special cases like contractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Vocabulary Building*:\n",
    "    - Once the text is tokenized, a vocabulary is constructed. This vocabulary consists of all unique words (or tokens) that appear in the corpus (collection of documents).\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Word Frequency Count*:\n",
    "    - For each document in the corpus, a vector is created where each element represents the frequency of a word in the document. These vectors can be very high-dimensional, with each dimension corresponding to a word in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Sparse Matrix Representation*:\n",
    "    - The result of BoW is often represented as a sparse matrix. A sparse matrix is a data structure that only stores non-zero elements, which are the counts of words in this case. This is efficient in terms of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Normalization (Optional)*:\n",
    "    - Depending on the specific task, the frequency counts can be normalized to make them more comparable across different documents. Common normalization techniques include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Feature Vectors*:\n",
    "    - Each document is represented as a feature vector where each element corresponds to the frequency of a specific word in the vocabulary. The order of the words does not matter, hence the term \"bag of words\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Loss of Contextual Information*:\n",
    "    - One limitation of BoW is that it completely ignores the order of words and any contextual information. For example, \"not good\" and \"good not\" would be represented the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *High Dimensionality*:\n",
    "    - BoW can lead to high-dimensional feature spaces, especially for large vocabularies and extensive documents. This can impact the efficiency of some machine learning algorithms.\n",

    "- *Application in Machine Learning*:\n",
    "    - BoW vectors are commonly used as input features for various machine learning models. For example, in sentiment analysis, these vectors can be fed into a classifier to predict the sentiment of a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Notes: </u>\n",
    "BoW is a powerful and versatile technique, but it may not be suitable for tasks where word order or context is crucial (e.g., language translation or tasks requiring understanding of semantics). In such cases, more advanced techniques like word embeddings or deep learning models may be more appropriate.\n",

    "- **`max_df`**: (maximum document frequency)\n",
    "    - This parameter specifies the threshold for the maximum frequency a term (word) can occur in the documents. Terms that occur more frequently than this threshold will be ignored. It can be set as an absolute count (e.g., max_df=5 means ignore terms that occur in more than 5 documents) or as a proportion (e.g., max_df=0.85 means ignore terms that occur in more than 85% of the documents).\n",
    "- **`min_df`**: (minimum document frequency):\n",
    "    - This parameter specifies the threshold for the minimum frequency a term must occur in the documents. Terms that occur less frequently than this threshold will be ignored. It can be set as an absolute count (e.g., min_df=2 means ignore terms that occur in fewer than 2 documents) or as a proportion (e.g., min_df=0.1 means ignore terms that occur in fewer than 10% of the documents).\n",
    "- **`max_features`**:\n",
    "    - This parameter specifies the maximum number of features (terms) to include in the vocabulary. It selects the max_features most frequently occurring terms in the dataset. This can be useful to limit the number of features in cases where the vocabulary is very large.\n",
    "- **`binary`**:\n",
    "    - When set to True, this parameter specifies that the CountVectorizer should return binary values (0 or 1) instead of the count of occurrences. This means that a term either occurs or it doesn't in a document.\n",
    "- **`ngram_range`**:\n",
    "    - This parameter takes a tuple of two values (*min_n, max_n*) where min_n is the minimum size of the n-grams and max_n is the maximum size of the n-grams."

    "The **Bag of N-grams model** is an extension of the Bag of Words (BoW) model used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). While BoW treats each word as a separate entity and disregards word order, **the Bag of N-grams model considers sequences of N consecutive words, or \"N-grams,\" in a text**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The corpus **vocabulary**, $V$, **is a collection of all unique n-grams across the text corpus**. Then, each document in the corpus is represented by a vector of length $|V|$. This vector simply contains the frequency counts of n-grams present in the document and zero for the n-grams that are not present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bag of N-grams model:\n",
    "- *N_grams*:\n",
    "    - An N-gram is a contiguous sequence of N items from a given sample of text or speech. In the context of language, these \"items\" are usually words.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Types of N-grams*:\n",
    "    - <u>Unigrams (N=1) </u>: Each word is treated individually. The sentence \"The quick brown fox\" would be represented as [\"The\", \"quick\", \"brown\", \"fox\"].\n",
    "    - <u>Bigrams (N=2) </u>: Sequences of two consecutive words are considered. The same sentence would be represented as [\"The quick\", \"quick brown\", \"brown fox\"].\n",
    "    - <u>Trigrams (N=3) </u>: Sequences of three consecutive words are considered. The sentence would be represented as [\"The quick brown\", \"quick brown fox\"].\n",
    "    - And so on for higher values of N.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Bag of N-grams*:\n",
    "    - Like the Bag of Words model, the Bag of N-grams model represents text data as a collection of features, but instead of individual words, it considers N-gram sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Feature Extraction*:\n",
    "    - The process involves creating a vocabulary of all unique N-grams in the corpus. Each document is then represented as a vector, where each element corresponds to the frequency of an N-gram in the vocabulary.\n",
    "      Example: Consider the sentence: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" For bigrams, the Bag of N-grams representation might include features like \"The quick\", \"quick brown\", \"brown fox\", \"fox jumps\", \"jumps over\", \"over the\", \"the lazy\", \"lazy dog\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Preserving Context*:\n",
    "    - By considering sequences of words, the Bag of N-grams model captures some degree of context, which can be important for tasks like sentiment analysis, where the meaning of a sentence can change drastically based on word order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Limitations*:\n",
    "    - As N increases, the number of unique N-grams in the vocabulary can grow exponentially, potentially leading to high-dimensional feature spaces and increased computational requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bag of N-grams model is useful for tasks where word order and context are important, such as machine translation, part-of-speech tagging, and some types of sentiment analysis. It provides a compromise between the simplicity of Bag of Words and the context-awareness of more sophisticated models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Notes </u>:\n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "    - *Easy implementation*.\n",
    "    - *It captures some context and word-order information in the form of n-grams*.\n",
    "    - Thus, *the resulting vector space can capture some semantic similarity*. **Documents having the same n-grams will have their vectors closer to each other in Euclidean space as compared to documents with completely different n-grams**.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "    - *As $n$ increases, dimensionality (and therefore sparsity) only increases rapidly, slowing down the algorithm*.\n",

    "**TF-IDF** **is a statistical measure** used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and information retrieval **to evaluate the importance of a word within a document relative to a collection of documents, often referred to as a corpus**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tf-Idf aims to quantify the importance of a given word relative to other words in the document and in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind TF-IDF is as follows: if a word $w$ appears many times in a sentence $S_1$ but does not occur much in the rest of the Sentences $S_n$ in the corpus, then the word $w$ must be of great importance to the Sentence $S_1$. The importance of $w$ should increase in proportion to its frequency in $S_1$ (how many times that word occurs in sentence $S_1$), but at the same time, its importance should decrease in proportion to the word’s frequency in other sentences $S_n$ in the corpus. Mathematically, this is captured using two quantities: *TF* and *IDF*. The two are then multiplied to arrive at the TF-IDF score.\n",
    "- **TF (term frequency)**: It measures the frequency of a term (word) within a document. It indicates how often a word appears in a document relative to the total number of words in that document.\n",
    "    Mathematical Expression of TF:\n",
    "    $$\\text{TF}(t,d) = \\displaystyle\\frac{\\text{Number of occurrences of term $t$ in document $d$}}{\\text{Total number of terms in the document $d$}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In a document with 100 words, if the word \"apple\" appears 5 times, its TF score is 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IDF (Inverse Document frequency)**: It measures the importance of a term across a collection of documents (corpus). It assigns a weight to each term based on how common or rare it is in the entire corpus. Words that are common across many documents receive a lower weight, while rare words receive a higher weight.\n",
    "     It’s a well-known fact that stop words like *is, are, am*, etc., are not important, even though they occur frequently. To account for such cases, IDF weighs down the terms that are very common across a corpus and weighs up the rare terms. IDF of a term $t$ is calculated as follows:\n",
    "     $$\\text{IDF}(t) = \\log_e\\displaystyle\\frac{\\text{Total number of documents in the corpus}}{\\text{Number of documents with term $t$ in them}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If there are 1,000,000 documents in the corpus and the word \"apple\" appears in 10,000 of them, its IDF score is approximately 4.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TF_IDF Score**: The TF-IDF score of a term in a document is the product of its TF and IDF scores. It indicates how important a term is to a specific document in the context of the entire corpus.\n",
    " $$\\text{TF-IDF}(t,d,D) = \\text{TF}(t,d)\\cdot\\text{IDF}(t,D)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If \"apple\" has a TF of 0.05 and an IDF of 4.0, its TF-IDF score is 0.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to BoW, **we can use the TF-IDF vectors to calculate the similarity between two texts using a similarity measure like Euclidean distance or cosine similarity**. TF-IDF is a commonly used representation in application scenarios such as information retrieval and text classification. However, even though TF-IDF is better than the vectorization methods we saw earlier in terms of capturing similarities between words, it still suffers from the curse of high dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Notes </u>:\n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "    - *Information Retrieval*. It captures a bit of the semantics of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "    - Its *implementation is not that easy* as compared to BoW, OHE, N-grams\n",
    "    - I have a *fixed-length encoding for any sentence of arbitrary length*.\n",
    "    - The feature vectors are high-dimensional representations. The *dimensionality increases with the size of the vocabulary*.\n",

    "1. All text representations are inherently biased based on what they saw in training data. For example, an embedding model trained heavily on technology news or articles is likely to identify Apple as being closer to, say, Microsoft or Facebook than to an orange or pear.\n",
    "2. Unlike the basic vectorization approaches, pre-trained embeddings are generally large-sized files (several gigabytes), which may pose problems in certain deployment scenarios. This is something we need to address while using them, otherwise it can become an engineering bottleneck in performance. The Word2vec model takes ~4.5 GB RAM."

    "- The primary goal of CBOW is **to learn distributed representations** (**vectors**) of words. *These representations are continuous and capture semantic relationships between words*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture**:\n",
    "- **CBOW is a shallow neural network model with one hidden layer**. It has *an input layer*, *a projection layer* (hidden layer), and *an output layer*. **The input and output layers have the same number of neurons, which is equal to the size of the vocabulary**.\n",
    "![CBoW](figures/CBoW.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**:\n",
    "- The input to the CBOW model is a **set of context words** (surrounding words) that are used to predict a target word. *The number of context words is determined by a fixed-size window around the target word*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "- The output layer of CBOW **predicts the probability distribution of the target word given the context words**.\n",

    "**Training Process**:\n",
    "- During training, **the model is presented with pairs of context words and their corresponding target words**. The *weights of the neural network are adjusted using techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize the prediction error*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context Window**:\n",
    "- The context window **determines the number of words to consider on either side of the target word**. For example, with a context window of 2, if the target word is in the middle, the model considers 2 words to the left and 2 words to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word Probability**:\n",
    "- The output of the model is a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary. Each element of the output vector represents the **probability of a specific word being the target word given the context**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loss Function**:\n",
    "- The loss function used in CBOW is typically a **softmax function**, which **measures the difference between predicted probabilities and actual labels**.\n",

    "**Word2vec** is a technique for natural language processing (NLP) published in 2013. It is designed to represent words as continuous vectors in a high-dimensional space, such that semantically similar words are located close to each other in this space. The word2vec algorithm **uses a neural network model** to learn word associations from a large corpus of text. Once trained, such a **model can detect synonymous words or suggest additional words for a partial sentence**. Word2vec is not a singular algorithm, rather, it is **a family of model architectures and optimizations** that can be used to learn word embeddings from large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec is the representation of words that allows words with the same meaning to have similar representation. Word2vec operationalizes this by projecting the meaning of the words in a vector space where words with similar meanings will tend to cluster together, and works with very different meanings are far from one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DETAILED EXPLANATION**:\n",
    "**Two Models**:\n",
    "- Word2Vec consists of two models:\n",
    "    - *Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)*: This model predicts the current word based on its context (surrounding words).\n",
    "    - *Skip-gram*: This model predicts the surrounding words given the current word.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neural Network Architecture**:\n",
    "- Both CBOW and Skip-gram models are shallow neural networks with one hidden layer. The input layer and output layer have the same number of neurons, which is equal to the size of the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word Context**:\n",
    "- The context of a word is determined by a fixed-size window of adjacent words. The model tries to predict the target word based on this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word Vectors**:\n",
    "- The weights of the hidden layer of the neural network serve as the word vectors (also called word embeddings). These vectors are what Word2Vec is primarily interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Process**:\n",
    "- During training, the model is presented with a large corpus of text. It adjusts the weights of the neural network using techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize the prediction error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic Similarity**:\n",
    "- After training, words that have similar meanings tend to have similar vector representations. For example, the vectors for \"king\" and \"queen\" are likely to be close to each other in the vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arithmetic Operations**:\n",
    "- One of the interesting properties of Word2Vec is that vector operations in the embedding space can capture semantic relationships. For example, \"king - man + woman\" might be close to \"queen\" in the vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-trained models**\n",
    "Word2Vec models can be pre-trained on large corpora and then used in downstream NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more. Pre-trained models are available for various languages and domains.\n",
    "Training your own word embeddings is a pretty expensive process (in terms of both time and computing). Thankfully, for many scenarios, it’s not necessary to train your own embeddings, since someone has done the hard work of training word embeddings on a large corpus, such as Wikipedia, news articles, or even the entire web, and has put words and their corresponding vectors on the web.

    "\n",
    "3. There are also other approaches that handle the OOV problem by modifying the training process by *bringing in characters and other subword-level linguistic components*. The key idea is that one can potentially handle the OOV problem by using subword information, such as morphological properties (e.g., prefixes, suffixes, word endings, etc.), or by using character representations. **fastText**, from Facebook AI research, is one of the popular algorithms that follows this approach.\n"

    "Training a Word2Vec model involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Preparation**:\n",
    "- Gather a large corpus of text data. This could be a collection of articles, books, tweets, or any other type of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing**:\n",
    "- Clean and preprocess the text data. This may include tasks like removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, handling special characters, and tokenizing the text into words or subword units.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Building Vocabulary**:\n",
    "- Create a vocabulary from the preprocessed text data. The vocabulary consists of a unique set of words or subword units that occur in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word2Vec Architecture**:\n",
    "- Choose between two Word2Vec architectures: Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) or Skip-gram. CBOW predicts a target word given its context, while Skip-gram predicts context words given a target word.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Initialization**:\n",
    "- Set hyperparameters like the embedding dimension (size of word vectors), context window size, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training**:\n",
    "- Use the preprocessed text data to train the Word2Vec model. During training, the model adjusts its weights to predict context words based on target words (for Skip-gram) or vice versa (for CBOW).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word Vectors**:\n",
    "- After training, the weights of the hidden layer serve as word vectors (word embeddings). These vectors represent words in a high-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation**:\n",
    "- Optionally, evaluate the quality of the word vectors. This can be done by measuring the similarity between words, performing analogy tasks, or using them as features in downstream NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application**:\n",
    "- Use the trained Word2Vec model for various NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, machine translation, named entity recognition, and more. The pre-trained word vectors can also be used in tasks where transfer learning is beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that the specific implementation details may vary depending on the library or framework you're using. Popular libraries for Word2Vec implementation include Gensim (Python), TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Each of these libraries has its own API for training Word2Vec models."

    "The **simple_preprocess** function from the *gensim.utils* module is a utility **used for text processing in the context of natural language processing (NLP) tasks**.\n",
    "Here's why it's useful:\n",
    "*Text Tokenization*:\n",
    "- **simple_preprocess** is primarily used for tokenizing text. It takes a text input and converts it into a list of tokens (words or subword units) based on certain criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Preprocessing*:\n",
    "- It performs basic preprocessing tasks like converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, and handling special characters. This is important for standardizing text data before further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Control over Tokenization*:\n",
    "- You can customize the behavior of simple_preprocess by specifying parameters like minimum and maximum token length, controlling whether to perform lowercasing, and more. This gives you flexibility in how you want to tokenize your text.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Compatibility with Gensim Models*:\n",
    "- Gensim, a popular library for natural language processing, often requires text data to be preprocessed and tokenized before using it with models like Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, etc. simple_preprocess provides a convenient way to prepare text data for use with Gensim models.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Memory Efficiency*:\n",
    "- **simple_preprocess** is designed to be memory-efficient, which is important when dealing with large corpora or datasets. It processes text in a streaming fashion, making it suitable for handling large volumes of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Suitability for Gensim Pipelines*:\n",
    "- It fits well into data preprocessing pipelines within the Gensim framework. You can use it as a first step in preparing text data for subsequent NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Simplicity and Ease of Use*:\n",
    "- As the name implies, simple_preprocess is straightforward to use. It doesn't require complex configurations or parameter tuning, making it accessible for users at various levels of expertise."

    "### PCA for Vectorization of Words\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Word2Vec vectorization, PCA can be applied for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Reducing Computation Costs*:\n",
    "- Word2Vec models often generate high-dimensional word embeddings (e.g., 100-dimensional or 300-dimensional vectors). Operating on such high-dimensional data can be computationally expensive. PCA can help reduce the dimensionality of the vectors, making subsequent operations more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Visualizing Word Embeddings*:\n",
    "- PCA can be used to project high-dimensional word embeddings onto a lower-dimensional space (e.g., 2D or 3D). This allows for visualization of the relationships between words. While it's not always feasible to visualize high-dimensional spaces, lower-dimensional representations obtained via PCA can provide insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Removing Redundant Information*:\n",
    "- Some dimensions in high-dimensional space may contain redundant or noisy information. PCA can identify and remove these dimensions, retaining only the most important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Handling Noise in the Data*:\n",
    "- Word embeddings may contain noise or irrelevant information. By reducing the dimensionality, PCA can filter out some of this noise, potentially improving the quality of the embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Facilitating Downstream Tasks*:\n",
    "- In some NLP tasks, lower-dimensional embeddings may be more suitable. For example, tasks like clustering, classification, or visualization may benefit from lower-dimensional representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Interpretability*:\n",
    "- Lower-dimensional embeddings are easier to interpret and understand compared to high-dimensional vectors. They can provide insights into the underlying relationships between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Storage and Memory Efficiency*:\n",
    "- High-dimensional vectors require more storage space and memory compared to lower-dimensional representations. PCA can help reduce these requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Maintaining Semantic Information*:\n",
    "- PCA is designed to retain the most important information while reducing dimensionality. This means that after PCA, the resulting vectors still capture much of the semantic information present in the original embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u> **Note** </u>:\n",
    "It's important to note that while PCA can be beneficial in some cases, **it's not always necessary or suitable for every application of Word2Vec. The decision to use PCA should be based on the specific requirements and constraints of the task at hand**."

    "\n",
    "**Doc2Vec is an extension of the Word2Vec model that is used for generating vector representations of documents**. While Word2Vec generates vector representations for individual words, **Doc2Vec generates vector representations for entire documents, including sentences, paragraphs, or even entire articles**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Doc2Vec works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Paragraph Vector**:\n",
    "    In Doc2Vec, **each document is represented as a unique vector**. This vector is sometimes referred to as a \"paragraph vector\" or \"document vector\". It captures the semantics and context of the entire document.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Similarity and Operations**:\n",
    "    **Doc2Vec allows you to compute similarity between documents and perform operations similar to Word2Vec**. For example, you can find documents similar to a given document, or find the document that best matches a set of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two Training Models**:\n",
    "    Like Word2Vec, **Doc2Vec has two training models: Distributed Memory (DM) and Distributed Bag of Words (DBOW)**.\n",
    "        - **Distributed Memory (DM)**: This model tries to predict a word based on its context and the entire document. It takes into account both the document and the surrounding context when generating the paragraph vector.\n",
    "        - **Distributed Bag of Words (DBOW)**: This model tries to predict a word based solely on the document. It doesn't take context into account, only the content of the document itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Combining Word Vectors**:\n",
    "    **In** the **DM model, word vectors and document vectors are combined to make predictions**. This allows the model to capture both the semantics of individual words and the context of the entire document.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Process**:\n",
    "    The training process **involves updating the vectors to minimize the prediction errors**. **The model learns to generate accurate vectors that can predict words or documents within the given context**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Applications**:\n",
    "    Doc2Vec is used in a **wide range of applications, including document classification, sentiment analysis, information retrieval, and recommendation systems**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gensim Implementation**:\n",
    "    Gensim is a popular Python library for training and using Doc2Vec models. It provides an easy-to-use interface for creating and working with document vectors."

    "**GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)** is an unsupervised learning algorithm for generating word embeddings. It was introduced by researchers at Stanford University and was launched in 2014. The **main objective** of GloVe is to **create word vectors (embeddings) that represent the semantic relationships between words**. These vectors are numerical representations of words in a continuous vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Co-occurrence Matrix**:\n",
    "- **GloVe starts by constructing a co-occurrence matrix from a large corpus of text**. This matrix captures how often words co-occur with each other within a specified context window. Rows and columns correspond to words, and each cell contains the number of times the word in the row occurs in the context of the word in the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimization Objective**:\n",
    "- GloVe aims to learn word embeddings in such a way that their dot product equals the logarithm of the words' co-occurrence probabilities. The objective function combines the information from the co-occurrence matrix to achieve this goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Process**:\n",
    "- The training process of GloVe involves **minimizing the loss function** that quantifies the difference between the predicted co-occurrence probabilities and the actual probabilities in the co-occurrence matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word Similarities**:\n",
    "- **Once trained, GloVe embeddings place words with similar meanings close to each other in the vector space**. This enables operations like word analogy tasks (e.g., \"king\" - \"man\" + \"woman\" = \"queen\") and finding semantically related words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dimensionality**:\n",
    "- **GloVe allows users to specify the desired dimensionality of the resulting word vectors**. For example, a common choice is 50, 100, or 300 dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-trained Models**:\n",
    "- Pre-trained GloVe models are available for a wide range of languages and can be used for various NLP tasks. These models have been trained on large text corpora and capture general linguistic patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications**:\n",
    "- GloVe embeddings are used in a variety of NLP tasks, including **sentiment analysis**, **machine translation**, **question answering**, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "- GloVe is known for its **efficiency and ability to capture both syntactic and semantic relationships between words**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**:\n",
    "- GloVe does **not capture polysemy** (multiple meanings of a word) as effectively as some other models. Additionally, it may struggle with rare words or words not present in the training corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed knowledge about GloVe Word Embedding, refer to [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/light-on-math-ml-intuitive-guide-to-understanding-glove-embeddings-b13b4f19c010)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Glove**:\n",
    "1. The goal of Glove is very straightforward, i.e., to enforce the word vectors to capture sub-linear relationships in the vector space. Thus, it proves to perform better than Word2vec in the word analogy tasks.\n",
    "2. Glove adds some more practical meaning to word vectors by considering the relationships between word pair and word pair rather than word and word.\n",
    "3. Glove gives lower weight for highly frequent word pairs to prevent the meaningless stop words like “the”, “an” will not dominating the training progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages of Glove**:\n",
    "1. The model is trained on the co-occurrence matrix of words, which takes a lot of memory for storage. Especially, if you change the hyper-parameters related to the co-occurrence matrix, you have to reconstruct the matrix again, which is very time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages and disadvantages can be found in [this site](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-Word2vec-and-GloVe)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Like the Word2Vec, can not deal directly with the OOV.\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Differences between GloVe and Word2Vec Embeddings**\n",
    "\n",
    "The first important aspect in the comparison between Glove and Word2Vec is the advantage that GloVe have where, **unlike Word2vec, GloVe does not rely just on local statistics (local context information of words), but incorporates global statistics (word co-occurrence) to obtain word vectors**. Thus, The GloVe can be used to find relations between words like synonyms, company-product relations, zip codes, and cities, etc. This is way, based on the NLP current task, we need sometimes to use GloVe instead of Word2Vec: Word2Vec relies only on local information of language, that is, the semantics learned for a given word, are only affected by the surrounding words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Both Word2vec and Glove do not solve the problems like**:\n",
    "1. How to learn the representation for out-of-vocabulary words.\n",
    "2. How to separate some opposite word pairs. For example, “good” and “bad” are usually located very close to each other in the vector space, which may limit the performance of word vectors in NLP tasks like sentiment analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "- *Subword Embeddings*:\n",
    "    FastText breaks words into smaller units called **\"subwords\"** or **\"n-grams\"**. For example, the word \"fast\" can be represented as *\"fa\"*, *\"ast\"*, and *\"fast\"*. This allows **FastText to capture morphological information and handle out-of-vocabulary words**.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Character-level Embeddings*:\n",
    "    **FastText also considers individual characters as special n-grams**, which means it can **generate embeddings for words even if they are not present in the training data**.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Handling Rare Words*:\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Pre-trained Models*:\n",
    "    **Pre-trained FastText models are available for multiple languages and domains**. These models have been trained on large text corpora and can be used in various NLP tasks.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Training Objective*:\n",
    "    **FastText aims to predict the next word in a sentence given its preceding words**. This is similar to Word2Vec's Skip-gram model, but FastText considers subwords instead of entire words. To prepare the training data, you define the \"context word\" as the word that follows a given word (that will be your \"target word\"). This means you will predict the surrounding word for a given word.\n",

    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "    - *Subword Information*: FastText can handle out-of-vocabulary words and rare words effectively by breaking them down into subword units (n-grams). This allows it to capture morphological information.\n",
    "    - *Character-level Embeddings*: It considers individual characters as special n-grams, which means it can generate embeddings for words even if they are not present in the training data.\n",
    "    - *Efficient Handling of Rare Words*: FastText is particularly effective at handling rare words, misspellings, and noisy text data.\n",
    "    - *Language Agnostic*: It can work well with multiple languages and handle a wide variety of languages effectively.\n",
    "    - *Pre-trained Models*: Pre-trained FastText models are available for various languages and domains, making it easy to leverage existing embeddings.\n",
    "    - *Supervised Learning*: FastText can be used for supervised tasks where it learns to predict labels from input text. This makes it a versatile tool for various NLP tasks.\n",
    "    - *Training Efficiency*: FastText is known for its efficiency in training and generating embeddings, even for very large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "    - *Increased Memory Consumption*: Due to the subword information and character-level embeddings, FastText models can be memory-intensive compared to traditional word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Slower Prediction Time*: While training is efficient, predicting word vectors can be slower compared to models like Word2Vec.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Difficulty in Interpretation*: The subword information can make the interpretation of embeddings more complex compared to traditional word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Lack of Context Awareness*: FastText may not capture contextual information as well as more sophisticated models like contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Dependency on Parameter Tuning*: The performance of FastText can be sensitive to parameter choices, so fine-tuning may be required for optimal results.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *May Not Be Ideal for All Tasks*: While FastText is versatile, there are specialized models (e.g., BERT for contextual understanding) that may outperform it in specific NLP tasks.\n",

    "- **`sentences`**:\n",
    "    This parameter is used to specify the input data for training the FastText model. It can be a list of sentences or an iterable that yields sentences.\n",

    "- **`vector_size`**:\n",
    "    This parameter determines the dimensionality of the word vectors. For example, if set to 100, each word will be represented by a vector of 100 dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`window`**:\n",
    "    It defines the maximum distance between the current and predicted word within a sentence. The default value is 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`min_count`**:\n",
    "    This parameter specifies the minimum frequency of a word in the corpus for it to be considered during training. Words that occur fewer times will be ignored. The default value is 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`sg`**:\n",
    "    Skip-gram vs CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words). If sg is set to 1, the Skip-gram model is used; if it's set to 0, CBOW is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`negative`**:\n",
    "    It specifies how many \"negative\" samples should be drawn for each positive sample during training. More negative samples can lead to a more accurate model, but also require more computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`ns_exponent`**:\n",
    "    This parameter sets the exponent used to shape the negative sampling distribution. The default value is 0.75.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`alpha`**:\n",
    "    The initial learning rate for training. It will gradually decrease as the training progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`min_n`** and **`max_n`**:\n",

    "    This parameter determines whether word n-grams should be used in addition to word vectors. By default, it's set to 1.\n",

    "- **`workers`**:\n",
    "    The number of CPU cores to use for training. By default, it's set to 3.\n",
