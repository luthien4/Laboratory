    "- **Corpus**: is the entire collection of texts used for analysis or modeling (machine learning tasks, or to train NLP models)\n",
    "    - *Example*: The entire collection of Wikipedia articles in English, a collection of legal documents, or a set of medical research papers can all be considered corpora.\n",
    "- **Vocabulary** ($V$): is the set of unique words (or tokens) present in a corpus. It represents the entire lexical repertoire of a language or domain.\n",
    "    - *Example*: In a corpus of scientific articles, the vocabulary would include terms like \"hypothesis,\" \"experiment,\" \"data,\" etc.\n",
    "- **Document**: is a single unit of text within the corpus, often representing a separate entity. It can be a single article, a sentence, a paragraph, or any chunk of text that is considered as a separate entity for analysis.\n",
    "    - *Example*: In a corpus of news articles, each individual news article is considered a document.\n",
    "- **Word**: is the basic linguistic unit, which can be a single word or a tokenized element in a text. These tokens can be words, punctuation marks, or other meaningful units.\n",
    "    - *Example*: In the sentence \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,\" the words are \"The,\" \"quick,\" \"brown,\" \"fox,\" \"jumps,\" \"over,\" \"the,\" \"lazy,\" and \"dog.\"\n",

    "**Core Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP), \"core intuition\" refers to the fundamental understanding or insight that underlies the way humans process and understand language. It is the foundational principle that guides the development of NLP models and algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some core intuitions in NLP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Semantics and Syntax*:\n",
    "    - Understanding that language has both semantic (meaning) and syntactic (grammar and structure) components. This intuition guides the development of models that can grasp the meaning of sentences and understand their grammatical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Context Matters*:\n",
    "    - Recognizing that the meaning of a word or phrase can change based on the surrounding context. For example, the word \"bank\" has different meanings in \"river bank\" and \"financial bank.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Ambiguity*:\n",
    "    - Acknowledging that language can be ambiguous, with words or phrases having multiple possible interpretations. NLP models need to be able to handle this ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Sequential Information*:\n",
    "    - Appreciating that the order of words in a sentence carries important information. This is particularly crucial for tasks like machine translation or sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Domain Specificity*:\n",
    "    - Understanding that language can be highly specialized and context-dependent, especially in technical or domain-specific domains. NLP models may need to adapt to different domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Pragmatics and Contextual Inference*:\n",
    "    - Realizing that communication often relies on pragmatic aspects, such as implicatures, presuppositions, and conversational implicatures. NLP models may need to infer information beyond the explicit content of a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Linguistic Variation*:\n",
    "    - Recognizing that language use can vary widely based on factors like dialect, socio-cultural context, and individual idiosyncrasies. NLP models need to be robust to these variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Figurative Language*:\n",
    "    - Understanding that language can include metaphors, similes, and other figurative expressions. NLP models may need to recognize and interpret these non-literal uses of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "These core intuitions serve as the basis for developing NLP models that can perform tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, machine translation, question answering, and more. They guide researchers and practitioners in designing algorithms that can effectively process and understand human language."

This compiled pattern can be reused for multiple operations, making it more efficient, especially when working with complex or frequently used regular expressions. Benefits of re.compile():\n",
    "    - *Improved Efficiency*: It can improve the performance of your code, especially if you are using the same regular expression in multiple places.\n",
    "    - *Readability*: It can make your code more readable by separating the pattern definition from its usage.\n",
    "    - *Facilitates Code Maintenance*: If you need to modify the regular expression later, you only have to do it in one place (where it's compiled), rather than multiple places where it's used.\n",
    "    - *Pre-Compile Complex Patterns*: For complex regular expressions, pre-compiling can help manage the complexity and make your code more organized.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- `re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)`: It performs a search-and-replace operation where:\n",
    "    - `pattern`: The regular expression pattern to search for in the string.\n",
    "    - `replacement`: The string to replace the matched patterns.\n",
    "    - `string`: The input string where the search and replace operation will be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- `re.findall(pattern, string, flags=0)`: It is a function in Python's **re** module (regular expressions) that allows you to find all non-overlapping occurrences of a pattern in a string. It returns a list of all the matching substrings or elements.\n",
    "    - `pattern`: This is the regular expression pattern you want to search for in the given string.\n",
    "    - `string`: The input string where you want to search for matches.\n",
    "    - `flags`: Optional. Flags can be used to modify the behavior of the regular expression. For example, you can use re.IGNORECASE to perform a case-insensitive search."

    "**TextBlob** is a Python library that provides a simple API for common natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It's built on top of NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and Pattern. It abstracts away many of the complexities of lower-level NLP tasks, allowing users to perform, among others, the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Sentiment Analysis*: **TextBlob** can determine the sentiment (polarity and subjectivity) of a piece of text. It can tell you whether a text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Part-of-Speech Tagging*: **TextBlob** can identify the grammatical parts of a sentence, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Noun Phrase Extraction*: It can extract noun phrases from text. This is useful for tasks like information extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Translation and Language Detection*: **TextBlob** supports translation between different languages and can detect the language of a given text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Word Inflection and Lemmatization*: It can convert words into their base or root form, which can be helpful for tasks like text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Spell Checking*: **TextBlob** can correct spelling mistakes in a given text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Tokenization*: It can break a text into individual words or sentences, a necessary step for many NLP tasks."

    "**Tokenization** is a process in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves breaking a text into individual units, or \"tokens.\" These tokens can be *words*, *sentences*, or even *subwords*, depending on the level of granularity required for the specific NLP task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization is a crucial preprocessing step in NLP pipelines because it converts raw text into a format that can be processed by machines. It enables the extraction of meaningful information and features from text, making it suitable for various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and more. Moreover, tokenization is not limited to English; it's a universal concept that applies to text in any language. Different languages may have specific tokenization rules based on their unique linguistic characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the type of project under analysis, there are three common types of tokenization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Word Tokenization*:\n",
    "    - This type of tokenization breaks a text into individual words. For example, the sentence \"Chatbots are amazing!\" would be tokenized into the following words: \"Chatbots\", \"are\", \"amazing\", and \"!\". Punctuation marks are usually treated as separate tokens.\n",
    "    - Word tokenization is one of the most fundamental steps in NLP, as many subsequent NLP tasks rely on individual words.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Sentence Tokenization*:\n",
    "    - Sentence tokenization involves splitting a text into individual sentences. For example, the paragraph \"This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence.\" would be tokenized into two sentences: \"This is the first sentence.\" and \"This is the second sentence.\"\n",
    "    - Sentence tokenization is important for tasks that require analysis at the sentence level, such as sentiment analysis or machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Subword Tokenization*:\n",
    "    - Subword tokenization breaks words into smaller units, which may be meaningful in some languages or for specific tasks. For instance, \"chatbots\" might be tokenized into \"chat\" and \"bots\". This is particularly useful for handling rare or out-of-vocabulary words.\n",
    "    - Subword tokenization is often used in tasks like machine translation and text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**:\n",
    "- *Prefix*: Character(s) at the beginning ---> $(\"\n",
    "- *Suffix*: Character(s) at the end ---> km),.!?\"\n",
    "- *Infix*: Character(s) in between ---> - -- / ...\n",
    "- *Exception*: Special-case rule to split a string into several tokens or prevent a token from being split when punctuation rules are applied ---> let's U.S."

    "**Stemming** is a text processing technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves **reducing words to their base or root form**. The resulting form may not always be a valid word, but it can help in tasks like text analysis, information retrieval, and text mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the stem of the words \"running\", \"runner\", and \"ran\" is \"run\". By reducing these words to their common base form, we can treat them as the same word in terms of their core meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different algorithms for stemming, and one of the most widely used is the *Porter stemming algorithm*. The goal of stemming algorithms is **to strip affixes (prefixes and suffixes) from words to obtain their root form**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming is useful in scenarios where you want to reduce the complexity of text data without being overly concerned about linguistic correctness. It's often used in tasks like information retrieval, search engines, and text mining, where reducing the variety of words can lead to more effective processing and analysis. However, **in contexts where linguistic precision is critical, more advanced techniques like lemmatization may be preferred**.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Speeds Up Processing*: It can improve the efficiency of text processing tasks since it reduces the number of distinct words that need to be handled.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- *May Produce Non-Standard Words*: The resulting stems may not always be real words. For instance, the stem of \"jumps\" is \"jump\", but the stem of \"jumping\" is also \"jump\". This doesn't always align with standard English.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- *May Produce Ambiguous Results*: Stemming can sometimes produce stems that are ambiguous. For example, the stem of \"meeting\" could be either \"meet\" or \"meat\", depending on the context.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Less Contextually Sensitive*: Stemming is a rule-based approach and doesn't take context into account. It applies predefined rules to trim affixes, which means it might not always capture the correct root word."
